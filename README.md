# Word count


Word counting project.
The initial premise of this project is the implementation of a system that is responsible for counting the number of times the words appear in the same text and show them sorted alphabetically or by number of appearances.

Starting from here, it is actually a project that does so by choosing between the following data structures:

    Binary tree
    AVL tree
    Hash table with AVL trees
    Ordered list
  
You can also choose to see the result, sorted by number of appearances or alphabetically, and shows results of memory
and time used to do both, the search and the sorting.

The objective of this is obvious, it is an educational project with the aim of comparing the different data structures used
in terms of the time used for the search and the sorting and the memory used.

The project includes the resulting technical memory of the practice since it was an elaborate memory and that it extracts conclusions from the comparisons done. I hope someone serves for something, even if only for a quick read. It's written in catalan though.
